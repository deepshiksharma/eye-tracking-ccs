# EyeTribe Reader
#
# Reads files as produced by PyTribe (https://github.com/esdalmaijer/PyTribe),
# and performs a very crude fixation and blink detection: every sample that
# is invalid (usually coded '0.0') is considered to be part of a blink, and
# every sample in which the gaze movement velocity is below a threshold is
# considered to be part of a fixation. For optimal event detection, it would be
# better to use a different algorithm, e.g.:
# Nystrom, M., & Holmqvist, K. (2010). An adaptive algorithm for fixation,
# saccade, and glissade detection in eyetracking data. Behavior Research
