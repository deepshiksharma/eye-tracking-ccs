# Eye Tracking Experiments
[work in progress]

**Equipment used**
- Eye-tracker: Tobii Pro Spectrum @ 1200 Hz
- Monitor: Eizo Flexscan EV2451, 1920x1080 @ 60 Hz

**Regarding Tobii timestamps**
- Timestamps are in microseconds [[1]].
- Both timestamps (`device_time_stamp` and `system_time_stamp`) are monotonic [[2]].
